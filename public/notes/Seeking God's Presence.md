### Key Points & Blessings

1.  **Divine Anointing & Promotion**: When you consistently seek God's presence, He anoints you with a special anointing that elevates you. Just as David was anointed King of Israel because he was a man after God's own heart, God will promote you in your life, career, and spiritual walk. He sees your faithfulness and will take you to the next level. 

2.  **Increased Strength & Resilience**: Seeking God's presence gives you supernatural strength to overcome life's challenges. The sermon contrasts David, who grew stronger and stronger, with Saul, who grew weaker because he did not prioritize God. When you face difficulties, God's power will be made perfect in your weakness. You won't crumble under pressure but will move from strength to strength.

3.  **Guaranteed Victory**: God grants victory in every aspect of your life when you prioritize Him. David was victorious in all his battles and was protected from his enemies, like Goliath and King Saul, because God's favor was upon him. When you seek God's presence, He will go before you and fight your battles, ensuring you triumph over every obstacle.

4.  **Honor and Recognition**: While we shouldn't seek worldly honor, when we honor God with our lives, He in turn honors us. Just as David was celebrated by the people after defeating the Philistines, God will grant you favor in the eyes of others. He will elevate you and make you a person of honor and respect.
